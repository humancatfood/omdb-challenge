# CognitionX Coding Challenge


Specs:
> We have built the prototype of an application that lets a user search for a movie and get some information about it. We plan to add
further functionality in future to allow user reviews and voting and other features you might expect on a movie web site.
>
> We are aware this style of javascript/jQuery probably won't be manageable as we build out the app.
>
> Right now we would like you to do the following:
>
>   1. Rewrite the current app using React/Redux & update the styling using SASS/Bootstrap. In comments please explain your design decisions in terms of how you structure the app.
>You should make any obvious usability improvements you think the app should have.
>
>   2. Add the ability for a user of the app to see the full details the OMDb API has about a film.
>
>If you find any bugs in the javascript/jQuery version of the app, please make sure they are fixed in your React/Redux version.
>
>Document how to install & run your app, and any development decisions you've made.
>
>Ideally you should spend at most 3 hours on this coding challenge. Good luck!
