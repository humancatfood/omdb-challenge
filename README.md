# CognitionX Coding Challenge


---

### How to run the project:

```sh
 > git clone git@github.com:humancatfood/omdb-challenge.git
 > cd omdb-challenge
 > npm install
 > npm run
```

then open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000/

---

### Development decisions:

- Created a separate page for individual films, rather than expanding the list-item to make room for more features.
- Focus the search box when going to the main-page.
- Throttled hitting the api.
- Make films sortable both ascending and descending

---

### Specs:

> We have built the prototype of an application that lets a user search for a movie and get some information about it. We plan to add
further functionality in future to allow user reviews and voting and other features you might expect on a movie web site.
>
> We are aware this style of javascript/jQuery probably won't be manageable as we build out the app.
>
> Right now we would like you to do the following:
>
>   1. Rewrite the current app using React/Redux & update the styling using SASS/Bootstrap. In comments please explain your design decisions in terms of how you structure the app.
>You should make any obvious usability improvements you think the app should have.
>
>   2. Add the ability for a user of the app to see the full details the OMDb API has about a film.
>
>If you find any bugs in the javascript/jQuery version of the app, please make sure they are fixed in your React/Redux version.
>
>Document how to install & run your app, and any development decisions you've made.
>
>Ideally you should spend at most 3 hours on this coding challenge. Good luck!

I did:
 
- Rewrite the app in React/Redux
- Change the styling to use SASS and bootstrap
- Add the ability for a user of the app to see the full details the OMDb API has about a film
- Make some improvements

I didn't:

- Add a lot of comments. I think the code is pretty self-explanatory.
- Split up the components as much as I would have done given more time.
- Spend less than 3 hours. I like coding :)
